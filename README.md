# boosting-ML-lithofacies-classification
The entire workflow of lithofacies classification using the boosting machine learning was fully implemented and visulaized by packages through R, an open-source powerful statistical programming language \citep{Rs06}. Each package has many different functions to conduct the various jobs of algorithms. In this research, four boosting machine learning algorithms were comparatively adopted for lithofacies modeling and prediction as a fucntion of well logging data. The boosting ML algorithms include Logistic Boosting Regression (LogitBoost), Generalized Boosting Modeling (GBM), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and Adaptive Boosting Model (AdaBoost). The R computer codes for LogitBoost, GBM, XGBoost, and AdaBoost were extended and developed from the packages caTools, gbm, xgboost, and fastAdaboost, respectively. Links for these packages were provided with the references of the aforementioned four boosting algorithms. These codes can be re-used to conduct faices classification in both clastic and carboante reservoirs in any field.
